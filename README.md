# Component Collection

A React component library and a set of interactive modules documented in Storybook.
Originally created as part of a design system for the [Griddo](https://griddo.io/) platform.

## What it is

This repository is a showcase of:

- **Atomic UI components** (buttons, inputs, selects, cards, messages)
- **Composed modules** built from those components (e.g. multi-step form, accordion, carousel, sticky anchors)
- A **Storybook-first** workflow for development and documentation

## Key features

- **Storybook as the primary UI** for browsing and testing components
- **CSS Modules + SCSS** for scoped styles and theming via CSS custom properties
- **Complex form flow** using `react-hook-form` (validation, multi-step UX, dynamic fields)
- **Animations** with `framer-motion`
- Clear separation: `components/` (atomic) vs `modules/` (composed features)
- Accessibility improvements are planned next (button semantics + aria attributes).
